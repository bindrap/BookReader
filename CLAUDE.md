Issues:
 - epub reader still does not work
 - website has slowed down when launching books to read when they are pdf 

To Do:
 - come up with a plan to address these issues
 - fix epub not being able to be read if this is not possible we will only use pdf's
 - make sure website is not clunky and as efficient as possible
    - maybe allow caching or some other solution to speed everything up and make sure it is seamless
 - Add a delete button for books as well
 - In Books folder here on server make inside it 3 folders for Novels, Manga and Textbooks where I can place stuff for all users without having to upload
