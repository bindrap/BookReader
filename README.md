## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run BookReader on any computer:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

2. **Start the Application**

   **Quick Start (Linux/Mac):**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   **Quick Start (Windows):**
   ```cmd
   start.bat
   ```

   **Or manually:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8669`
   - You'll be redirected to the login/registration page

4. **Stop the Application**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

5. **Update the Application**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose build --no-cache
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**Docker Notes:**
- All user data (books, users, settings) is stored in the `user_books/` directory and `users.json` file
- These are automatically persisted on your host machine even when the container is removed
- To change the JWT secret, create a `.env` file with `JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here`

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8669`
   - You'll be redirected to the login/registration page

### First Time Setup

1. **Important: Initial Docker Setup**
   - **If using Docker**: Before starting for the first time, create an empty `users.json` file:
     ```bash
     echo '{"users":[]}' > users.json
     ```
   - This prevents Docker from creating `users.json` as a directory, which would cause registration to fail
   - Then start normally with `docker compose up -d`

2. **Create an Account**
   - Click "Register here" on the login page
   - Enter a username (min 3 characters) and password (min 6 characters)
   - You'll be automatically logged in after registration

3. **Add Your Books**
   - Use the upload button (üì§) in the app to upload books
   - Or manually place books in `user_books/[your-user-id]/`
   - Each user's books are completely isolated

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/books`
Returns a list of all books in the Books folder.

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "base64-encoded-filename",
    "name": "Book Name",
    "type": "manga|pdf|epub",
    "path": "filename",
    "isDirectory": true,
    "size": 1234567,
    "modified": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### GET `/api/books/:bookId/pages`
Returns pages for a specific book (works for image-based manga).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "totalPages": 150,
  "pages": [
    {
      "pageNumber": 1,
      "filename": "001.jpg",
      "path": "manga-name/001.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET `/api/images/:bookName/:imageName`
Serves an individual image file from a manga folder.

### GET `/api/books/:bookId/file`
Serves a book file directly (for PDF/EPUB downloads).

### POST `/api/upload`
Upload books to the server.

**Request:**
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Field name: `books` (supports multiple files, max 10)
- Allowed types: .pdf, .epub, .cbz, .cbr, .mobi

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully uploaded 2 file(s)",
  "files": [
    { "name": "book.pdf", "size": 1234567 }
  ]
}
```

## Storage

### Progress Tracking

Reading progress is stored in the browser's localStorage with the following structure:

```json
{
  "bookReader_progress": {
    "book-id-1": {
      "page": 42,
      "totalPages": 200,
      "lastRead": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Progress is automatically saved every time you change pages and persists across browser sessions.

### Settings Storage

User preferences are stored in localStorage:

```json
{
  "bookReader_settings": {
    "theme": "light|dark|default",
    "bgColor": "#667eea"
  }
}
```

Settings persist across browser sessions and apply immediately when changed.

## Design Decisions

### Why This Architecture?

1. **No Database Required** - Uses filesystem as source of truth, localStorage for progress
2. **Simple Setup** - Just install and add books, no configuration needed
3. **Portable** - All progress stored client-side, easy to backup/export
4. **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, fast startup

### Why PDF.js for PDF Rendering?

PDF.js is Mozilla's battle-tested PDF renderer that runs entirely in the browser. This approach:
- Eliminates server-side PDF parsing complexity
- Provides smooth, native-like PDF reading experience
- Works offline after initial page load
- No server resources needed for rendering

### Why LocalStorage?

- No server-side database setup required
- Instant saves with no network latency
- Works offline after initial load
- Per-browser persistence (privacy by default)
